* Installing an Operating System
----------------------------------
-> Choosing an Operating System
-------------------------------
 - CPU architecture  - 32-bit or 64-bit architecture, the operating systems will also be optimized for this architecture. The CPU and the OS must be compatible;

- Os can come in  -  disk form, usb form, or downloaded from the internet; Installing an operating system many time using a single disk will not be time efficient or scalable;

-> Virtual Machines
---------------------
- A copy of a real machine;
- Work on another operating system on the existing onw. E.g Windows machine running an Linux os through virtualbox;
- VMs - use the physical Memory, CPU and storage, they add the benefit of running multiple operatimng systems at once. They are easier to maintain and provision;
- They reclaim the resources when they are no longer needed; (QLab);

-> Installing Windows 10 OS
--------------------------
- Ensure the BIOS UEFI boot order ste to boot from the USB drive in available;
- The userspace, main screen - desktopm, bottom right - task-bar, bottom-left -applications, files, etc, power off;
- System-setting;

-> Installing Linux
--------------------
- Multiple distributions, most popular - Ubuntu;
- The copied content must make the USB device bootable from the BIOS; Can use the tool - etcher.io - inorder to make it bootable;
- The shell - Terminal(in the GUI);
- echo -> print; echo $SHELL -> /bin/bash;
- echo Hello -> Hello;
* Create a file -> touch my_super_cool_file

-> Installing Mac OS X
------------------------
- Mac OS Preinstalled;
- similar to Linux os;
- The filemanager - Finder;
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* mkdir my-super-cool-folder
