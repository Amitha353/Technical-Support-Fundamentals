* Operating System
---------------------

An operating system - whole package that manages the computer's resources and lets users interact with it.

OS consists of 2 main parts
-----------------------------
1. User Space - Applications - System programs, user interfaces,text editors, music players, etc;
2. Kernel Space - Process Manager, Memory Manager, File Manager and I/O Manager;

Kernel - core of the operating system and talks directly to the hardware and manages system resources;
Users we interact with the 2nd part the user space and not the kernel directly;
Common OS - Windows(Microsoft), Mac, Linux(Business infrastructure and in consumer space);

Linux(Business infrastructure and in consumer space - Linux is a kernel developed by Linus Torvalds);
Different packages of Linux operating system - distribution - Ubuntu, Debian, Red Hat;

* Chrome OS and Android Os run the Linux kernel underneath the hood;

-> Kernel 
-a. File storage and File management;(documents, music file, etc);
-b. Process management - We have manyprograms on our system and we need to manage the order they run in, resources and time;
  - Process scheduler makes multitasking possible - It switches execution of process at a fast rate;
 -c. Memory Management - optimizes memory usage and makes sure the appllication has enough memory to run; 
 -d. I/O Management - This is how the kernel communicates with external devices - disks, network - anything input or output 
 from system;
