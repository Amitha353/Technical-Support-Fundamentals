Information Technology (IT)
-------------------------------
The use of digital technology, like computers and the Internet, to store and process data into useful information.
Network Engineers, Hardware technicians, desktop support personnel.

* Computer - A device that stores and processes data by performing calculations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Evolution
-------------
1. Abacus - primitive calculating device.
2. Mechanical Calculator - 17th century by Blaise Pascal ---> textile industry
3. Punch card - Joseph Jacquard - programmable loom - textile industry - holes on cards to hook a thread and spun up a
design pattern. (Punch cards were the first binary system used for machines);
4. Charles Babbage - machines of modern computing - difference engine - complicated math probs;
5. Charles Babbage - Analytical Engine - used punch card ideology to automatically perform computing - used punch cards
to enable people to predefine a series of calculations they wanted to perform. 
6. Ada Lovelace - used the analytical engine - developed the first algorithm for computer engine - first eg of computer
programming.(Analytic Engine - first general purpose computing machine in history);

* Algorithm - A series of steps that solve specific problems.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Path to Modern Computing

Major Developments post World War II
1. Cryptography - The art of writing and solving code.

* Alan Turing - mathematician and famous computer scientist - top-secret Enigma machine - helped allied forces decode access 
message during world war II.

* Until 1950s - punch cards were used to store data, stacks in ordered were needed to retrieve the data.
- New technological innovations like - magnetic tape and counterparts - store more data on more reliable media.
* A magnetic tape - worked by magnetizing data onto a tape - vinyl records / cassette tapes;

* Early machines took up a lot of space
 - huge machines to read data.
 - racks of vacuum tubes to help move that data.
 - vacuum tubes control the electricity voltages and electronic equipments like televisions and radios. (Bulky and broken)

* Grace Hopper - Harvard Mark II computer - source of a problem in a relay -> actually moth;
- ENIAC - Earliest forms of general purpose computers - 17,000 vacuum tubes , 1800 square feet floor space;
- Transistors (replacements for vacuum tubes) are now used to control electricity voltages - fundamental component of electronic devices;
- Grace Hopper invented the first compiler;

* Compiler - Translate human language via a programming language into a machine code.

* Emergence of the hard disk drives and microprocessors , then programming languages - way to develop computer software.

* Xerox Alto - first modern compuer; It had GUI - used icons, mouse and a window; (Xerox started building machines affordable 
and smaller form factor);

* 1970's - Steven Wozniak - invented Apple I - single-board computer MIT for hobbyists; Apple II success and afforable;

* 1980's - IBM - personal computer - os - MS DOC (Microsoft Disk Operating System); - partnership with microsoft.

* Microsoft - founded by Bill Gates - created Microsoft windows - dominated - cause it could be run on any compatible hardware.

* Video Games - 1970's - 80's - coin-operated entertainment machines - arcades - popular - Company Atari -1972 - pong;
- Unix - operating system developed by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie;
- Richard Stallman - developed a free Unix-like operating system. He created GNU - open source - to paved way to one of 
the largest open source operating system - Linux - created by Linus Torvalds.

* PDAs - Personal Digital Assistants - mobile computing - Nokia introduced a PDA with mobile phone functionality;
