Introduction to computer hardware
-----------------------------------
* Ports - Connection points that we can connect devices to that extend the functionality of our computer.
* CPU - central processing unit - it communicates heavily with the RAM.
* RAM (Random Access Memory) - Computer's short-term memory - used to store data temporarily.
* Hard drive - holds all of our data, which includes all of our music, pictures and applications. (long term memory);
* Motherboard - foundation of the computer - the body or circuitory system of the computer that connects all the pieces together.
* Power supply - electricity from wall outlet onto a format that our computer can use.


Program and Hardware
----------------------
* Programs - Instructions that tell the computer what to do.

* EDB - External Data Bus - Row of wires that interconnect the parts of our computer - whrn voltage is sent across a wire it's 
in state 1 else state 0. (transistors send voltage and the bits travel via the EDB);
- EDB comes in different sizes - 8 bit/ 16 bit / 32 bit / 64 bit (64 wires going);
- In the EDB - only one line of data can be sent at a time.

* Consider an 8 bit EDB -> CPU receives a byte . Inside the CPU there are components known as Registers.
* Registers - stores the data that our CPU works with.
* To add two numbers - one is stores in register A and the other in register B, and the result is stored in register C.

* MCC - Memory Controller Chip - It is the bridge between the CPU and the RAM. The MCB garbs the data from the RAM and
sends it via an EDB to the CPU.

* Address Bus - It connects the CPU and the MCC;
CPU  -----> Adress bus (sends the location of the data and nto the data itself) -----> MCC
MCC (looks for data from address in RAM) -----> External Data Bus -----(data)---------> CPU

* RAM is not the fastest way to get more data to the CPU, the CPU also uses cache.
* Cache - smaller than RAM but let's us store data often use / quickly reference.
- Cache - there are three different cache levels in a CPU : L1, L2, and L3;
- L1 - smallest and fastest cache;

* How does the CPU know when the set of instructions ends, and when a new one begins?
* CPU - has an internal clock - that keeps the operation in sync, it connects to a clock wire.

* When you send or receive dat, it sends a voltage to that clock wire to let the CPU know it can start doing calculations.
- Clock wire - ticking of a clock , for every tick the cpu does one cycle of operations.
- Clock cycle - when a voltage is sent to a clock wire.

- For huges commands that process lots of data , then a lot of clock cycles need to run.
* Clock Speed - The maximum number of clock cycles that it can handle in a certain time period. (3.40 ghz - gigahertz -
3.4 billion cycles per second).

* Overclocking - Increase the rate of CPU clock cycles in order to perform more tasks.
