Components
------------

* CPU
------
-> Common CPU/ chipset manufacturers - Intel (Intel Core i7), AMD (AMD Athlon), Qualcomm (Snapdragon 810), Apple (Apple A8).
-> CPU has an instruction set that enables it to process instructions.
-> When you select your CPU, you'll need to make sure it's compatible with your motherboard -- the circuit board that connects
all the components together;

-> 2 types of motherboard sockets - CPU and motherboard socket must match;
1. Land grid array (LGA)
2. Pin grid Array (PGA)

-> Require a Heat sink - to prevent the CPU from overheating;
- It takes the heat from the CPU and dissipates it through a fan/ another medium;

-> CPU architecture - based on the way CPU handles data.
1. 32 bit
2. 64 bit - handles large amounts of RAM more effectively (4GB), more responsive when running several programs at the same time 
and switching between them frequently.

* RAM (RAM stick needs to be compatible with the motherboard )
-----
- Computer's Short Term Memory - store data that we want to access quickly, it is volatile;
- The computer is comprised of programs, to run a program we need to make a copy of it in the RAM so that the CPU can process it.
- RAM - 16GB - 16 Gb of programs can be run in that time.

* Lots of RAMS, commonly found is - DRAM (Dynamic Random-Access Memory).
- DRAM : When a 1 or 0 is sent to DRAM it stores eash bit in a microscopic capacitor. Based on the value 1 or 0 the capitor is
charged or discharged. These semiconductors are put into a chip that are on the RAM and store the data.
- Different Memory sticks that DRAM chips can be put on:
- modern DIMM - Dual Inline Memory Module - have different sizes of pins on them.

* SDRAM - Synchronous DRAM
- This RAM is synchronized to the system's clock speed allowing quicker processing of data.

* DDR SDRAM - Double Data Rate SDRAM
-  DDR1, DDR2, DDR3, DDR4;
- faster, less power, larger capacity;
- programs can run faster and more programs can be run simultaneously;

* Motherboards
--------------
- Foundation that holds the computer together;
- expands computer functionality by adding expansion cards;
- routes power from supply;
- enables different parts of the computer to communicate with each other; (manages data between CPU, RAM and peripherals);

1. Chipset - decides how components communicate with each other in the machine.
 - chipset is made of 2 chips 
 a. Northbridge - interconnected RAM, Video cards , etc; (it could be integrated into CPU);
 b. Southbridge - maintain I/O controllers - hard drives, USB devices;

- Pheripherals - external devices we connect to our computer- mouse, keyboard, monitor, etc;

2. Expansion Slots - provide the ability to increase the functionality of the computer.
- Standard for expansion slots - PCI Express - Pheripheral Component Interconnect Express

3. Form factor 
- Different mother board sizes available, decide the amount that can be put into them.
- Common form factor - ATX (Advanced Technology eXtended) - diffeerent sizes;
- ITX - Information Technology eXtended;
