Components
------------

* CPU
------
-> Common CPU/ chipset manufacturers - Intel (Intel Core i7), AMD (AMD Athlon), Qualcomm (Snapdragon 810), Apple (Apple A8).
-> CPU has an instruction set that enables it to process instructions.
-> When you select your CPU, you'll need to make sure it's compatible with your motherboard -- the circuit board that connects
all the components together;

-> 2 types of motherboard sockets - CPU and motherboard socket must match;
1. Land grid array (LGA)
2. Pin grid Array (PGA)

-> Require a Heat sink - to prevent the CPU from overheating;
- It takes the heat from the CPU and dissipates it through a fan/ another medium;

-> CPU architecture - based on the way CPU handles data.
1. 32 bit
2. 64 bit - handles large amounts of RAM more effectively (4GB), more responsive when running several programs at the same time 
and switching between them frequently. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* RAM (RAM stick needs to be compatible with the motherboard )
-----
- Computer's Short Term Memory - store data that we want to access quickly, it is volatile;
- The computer is comprised of programs, to run a program we need to make a copy of it in the RAM so that the CPU can process it.
- RAM - 16GB - 16 Gb of programs can be run in that time.

* Lots of RAMS, commonly found is - DRAM (Dynamic Random-Access Memory).
- DRAM : When a 1 or 0 is sent to DRAM it stores eash bit in a microscopic capacitor. Based on the value 1 or 0 the capitor is
charged or discharged. These semiconductors are put into a chip that are on the RAM and store the data.
- Different Memory sticks that DRAM chips can be put on:
- modern DIMM - Dual Inline Memory Module - have different sizes of pins on them.

* SDRAM - Synchronous DRAM
- This RAM is synchronized to the system's clock speed allowing quicker processing of data.

* DDR SDRAM - Double Data Rate SDRAM
-  DDR1, DDR2, DDR3, DDR4;
- faster, less power, larger capacity;
- programs can run faster and more programs can be run simultaneously;

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Motherboards
--------------
- Foundation that holds the computer together;
- expands computer functionality by adding expansion cards;
- routes power from supply;
- enables different parts of the computer to communicate with each other; (manages data between CPU, RAM and peripherals);

1. Chipset - decides how components communicate with each other in the machine.
 - chipset is made of 2 chips 
 a. Northbridge - interconnected RAM, Video cards , etc; (it could be integrated into CPU);
 b. Southbridge - maintain I/O controllers - hard drives, USB devices;

- Pheripherals - external devices we connect to our computer- mouse, keyboard, monitor, etc;

2. Expansion Slots - provide the ability to increase the functionality of the computer.
- Standard for expansion slots - PCI Express - Pheripheral Component Interconnect Express

3. Form factor 
- Different mother board sizes available, decide the amount that can be put into them.
- Common form factor - ATX (Advanced Technology eXtended) - diffeerent sizes;
- ITX - Information Technology eXtended;
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Storage
-----------
- Data size :
 -> smallest unit of a data storage is a bit; (1/0)
 -> byte - comprised of 8 bits;
 -> 1 Kilobyte - 1024 bytes;
 -> 1 MB - 1024 KB
 -> 1 GB - 1024 MB
 -> 1 TB -> 1024GB
 
 - Hard Drive - allows to store programs files;
 -> 2 basic types of hard drives used:
  1. Hard disk drives - HDDs - use a spinning platter and a mechanical arm to read and write information; The speed the platter 
  rotates allows you to read and write data faster; - RPM (Revolution per Minute) ; (eg hard drive - 500gb - 5400 rpm);
  - affordable
  
  2. Solid state drives - SSDs - no moving parts - similar to USB stick- information is stored on microchips and data travels 
  a lot faster than HDDs. Form factor is slimmer than HDDs; expensive;
  
  Hybrid SSD and HDD drives;
  
  * Interfaces used by hard drives to connect to the system
  1. ATA interfaces  common and most popular is the serial ATA drive (SATA - uses one cable for data transfers) - cable;
  It's good for HDDs and not SDD's speed;
  
  2. NVM Express (NVMe) - Instead of a cable to connect the driver to the machine, the drive was added as an expansion slot
  which allows greater throughput of data and increased efficiency.
  
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * Power supplies
  ------------------
   - Computers - convert electricity from volts to useable;
   
   -> 2 types of electricity
   a. DC -direct current - flows in one direction;
   b. AC - alternate current - changes direction constantly;
   
   Computer uses DC and power supply provides AC; 
   Wall - AC --> Computer ---> low volt DC -> computer interior;
   
 -> Consists
 a. Fan
 b. voltage information
 c. cables -> motherboard
 d. power cable
 
 - Supply (220v) ---> Apliance (charger) 120V -> destroyed
 - Supply (120v) ---> Appliance (charger) 220v -> charges slowly;
 
 - Use proper voltage / pressue for your electronics;
 - Voltages - amount of electricity pushed out (volts);
 - Current - amount of electricity coming out (AMPs);
 - Wattage - The amount of volts and amps that a device needs; (500W);
  
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * Peripherals
  ------------------
  
  - USB - Universal Serial Bus - popular connections for gadgets; USB 2.0,3.0, and 3.1;
  - USB 2.0 - Transfer spead - 480 Mb/s (megabit per second) and not megabytes;
  - USB 3.0 - Transfer speed of 5 Gb/s
  - USB 3.1 - Transfer speed of 10 Gb/s
  - Backward compatible, olderr ones are compatible with newer ports;
  
  - Type-C Connector - new and common - outputs audio, video, data and power;
  
  -> Display peripherals - monitors have them
   - DVI cables are for video output;
   - HDMI - Video and audio output;
   - displayPort - outputs video and audio;
