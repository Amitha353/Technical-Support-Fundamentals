* BIOS
----------

-> Drivers / Services - The drivers contain the instructions the CPU needs to understand external devices (Keyboards, webcams, 
printers).
-> The CPU does not know about the device to talk to, so it has to connect to BIOS (Basic Input Output Services).
-> BIOS - It is the software that helps initialize the hardware in the computer and gets the operating system up and running.
-> The motherboard stores the BIOS in the ROM (Read only memory) chip, Rom is non-volatile;
-> Once the Operating System loads, the drivers are loaded from the hard drivers;

-> UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) - performs the same function of starting the computer as BIOS, but better 
compatible and new hardware support;

* POST
------
-> Power-on self test - the beep that occurs when the computer is switched on, the computer runs a test to ensure all the 
hardware is working correctly;
-> The BIOS runs it when the computer is booted;
-> The POST figures out what hardware is on the computer, then the BIOS initializes the hardware and loads up the essential
drivers.
-> In case the the hardware is malfunctioning, there is no way to display on the screen since the BIOS is not initialized;
-> Single beep - on power on - no problem;
-> Two beeps - POST error -> motherboard manual to check for the error;

* BIOS settings
----------------
-> Special chip on the motherboard - CMOS chip - It stores basic data about booting the computer - date, time, start up process;
-> Can change the CMOS/ BIOS setting;

* Frequent task
- Reimaging of a computer - refers to the a disk-image which is a copy of the operating system; (Process of wiping and
re-installing an operating system.)
