Software
----------
-> It is how users directly interact with the computer - 3 layer of the computer - e.g - Operating system, music program, etc;
-> The Hardware is the physical stuff that can be touched while the software is the intangible instructions that tell the hardware what to do;

-> Coding - Translating one language to another; English to computer languge, morse code, etc;When an application is being built it is termed as coding an application;
-> Scripting - coding in a scripting language, scripts are used to perform a single or limited range of tasks;
-> Programming - Coding in a programming language;
-> Programming languagea - Special languages that software developers use to write instructions for computers to execute;

* Types of Software
---------------------
- Copyright - used when creating original work, softwares can be copyright/ open-source;
1. Application Software - Any software created to fulfill a specific need, like a text editor, web browser, or graphic editor;
2. System Software - Software used to keep the core system running like the operating system tools and utilites;
3. Firmware - Software that is permanently stored on a computer component; - BIOS - helps to startup the hardware on the computer and load up the operating system;

* Abstraction
----------------
-> Programs are instructions to the CPU - binary code or bits are sent to the CPU
-> Then the instruction set is made use of to run the commands;
-> Abstraction - It is the process of taking a complex system and simplifying it for use;

* Computing
-------------
-> Earlier instructions where sent to puch cards, and the digits ion them where read by the cPU and stores in a memory location;
-> Then emerged Assembly Language; It allowed computer scientists to use human readable instructions, assembled code, that the machibe could understand - instead of binary they where machine instructions; Interget 1 from register 1 add integer 2 from register 2 and output in register 4;
-> Compiled programming languages - uses human readable instructions and then sends them through a compiler which translates it nto machine code - invented by Admiral Grace Hopper - 1959; - Compatible to run program on any CPU;
-> Interpreted Languages - they are not compiled ahead of time; A file that has code written in one of these languages is called a script;  - The script is run by an interpreter, which interprets the code into CPU instructions just in time to run them;

* Managing Software
--------------------
- Drivers - specific softwares that enable us to interact with the respective hardware;
- Applications - used for day to day job functions;
- Utilities - Calculators, setting, etc tools;

- Software Bug - An error in software that causes unexpected results;
- Software Management - Includes installing, updating, and removing the softwares;

* Git
--------
-> A version control system that helps keep track of changes made to files and directories;
-> .exe - A file extension found in Windows for an executable file;

* Ubuntu
--------
-> apt-get install git;
- apt - command used in Ubuntu's package manager;
- apt install git / sudo apt install git
- sudo - Superuser do
- remove - sudo apt remove git
